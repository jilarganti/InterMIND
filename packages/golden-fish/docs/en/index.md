## FAQ

:::details UAE Business Setup FAQ

### General Ownership Requirements

**Will there be restrictions on ownership if foreigners set up a UAE company?**

1. Obtain the necessary permissions from the relevant authorities.
2. Reserve the company name.
3. Prepare the incorporation documents.
4. Notarize the documents at the public courts.
5. Apply for the business license.
6. Register the company for VAT (if required).
7. Obtain work visas for clients and their employees.

**What are the benefits of starting a free zone entity in the UAE?**

UAE free zone companies offer several benefits, including:

1. No requirement for a resident shareholder, i.e., an FZ company can be 100% foreign-owned.
2. No obligation to hire staff.
3. No customs duties on goods entering or leaving the zone.
4. High-quality infrastructure.

### Directors and Shareholders

**How many directors must be appointed to register in a UAE free trade zone?**

Only one director is required to form a UAE free zone company.

### Logistics and Premises

**Am I required to visit the UAE to incorporate a company there?**

No, Golden Fish can legally incorporate your UAE company without you needing to travel.

**Do I need to rent premises for my company?**

The requirements differ based on the type of company:

| Company Type      | Office Requirement                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free Zone Company | A lease agreement for office premises or a flexi-desk is required before incorporation. |
| Mainland Company  | Only a virtual or registered address is needed.                                         |
| Offshore Company  | Only a virtual or registered address is needed.                                         |

This comparison table helps clarify the differences between the requirements for free zone, mainland, and offshore companies.

### Compliance and Taxation

**Will I be required to get a full audit if I set up a small business in the UAE?**

Yes, most entities will require audited financial statements.

**What are the tax implications of a UAE company setup?**

Corporate Income Tax (CIT) has been implemented in the UAE at a standard rate of 9%. Additionally, depending on the volume and nature of the business, some companies are liable for VAT (5%) and/or customs duties. Specific industries, such as oil and gas and branches of foreign banks, may have special tax considerations or exemptions.

**Is a UAE company required to submit an annual tax return and/or financial statement?**

4. Dubai Islamic Bank
5. Mashreq Bank

These banks are known for good customer service, which is essential when starting a new business in the UAE.

**How do I open an offshore bank account in the UAE?**

However, the KYC procedures will be more stringent than those for opening a bank account for a resident company. Attestation documents will also be required. Please refer to [our bank account opening guide for UAE companies](./uae-business/company-registration/banking) for more detailed information.
