## Works Like Google Meet + Live Translation

Familiar interface. Universal communication. Same ease as Google Meet — with instant translation that makes language barriers disappear.

<HowItWorksSection />

<span id="Example"></span>

## Example: How real-time speech translation works in a meeting

Let’s say:

> The user uses **Spanish** as the **site localization language**. They host a meeting and invite two participants:
>
> - 🧑‍💼 Participant 1 uses the interface in **English**
> - 👩 Participant 2 uses the interface in **Chinese**

### What happens during the meeting?

Each participant **speaks and hears** in the language they selected when entering the product.  
This single language setting applies to:

- The **interface language**
- The **spoken input** (what you say)
- The **translated output** (what you hear)

| Participant   | Language Selected | Speaks In | Hears In |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Host          | Spanish           | Spanish   | Spanish  |
| Participant 1 | English           | English   | English  |
| Participant 2 | Chinese           | Chinese   | Chinese  |

[The platform automatically interprets all speech in real time](./product/overview/how-it-works) — so everyone communicates as if they spoke the same language.

### Can you change your language during the call?

Yes. You can open the **Settings** and change the `Your Language` field:

:::details Settings Panel
<img src="/settings.png" alt="settings-panel" width="300px" />
:::

Changing this means:

- You should speak in the `chosen language` for accurate translation
- You will hear others in the `chosen language`
- The interface will automatically switch to the `chosen language`

> 📌 Note: “Your Language” is a **single unified setting**  
> It controls **how you speak**, **what you hear**, and **what you see**.  
> Speaking in one language and listening in another is **not supported** — by design, to keep the experience simple and predictable.
