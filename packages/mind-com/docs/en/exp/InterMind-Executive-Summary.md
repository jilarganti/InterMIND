# InterMind Executive Summary

## The Problem

Language barriers still block global business deals — especially in manufacturing, exports, and supply chains. Hiring interpreters is costly, slow, and not scalable.

## The Solution

**InterMind** is a professional video platform with real-time AI-powered interpretation. Every participant speaks and hears in their native language — instantly and privately.

## Why Now

- Remote work is permanent (75% of B2B sales online)
- AI translation now reaches near-human accuracy
- Emerging markets (LATAM, SEA, MENA) have low English proficiency but high trade volume

## Core Markets

Launching pilots in:

- **Mexico, Brazil** — export to US and EU
- **Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia** — industrial hubs with language mismatch

## Business Model
