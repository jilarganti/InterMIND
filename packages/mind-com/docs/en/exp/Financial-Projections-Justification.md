This document explains the assumptions behind InterMind's financial model for user growth, revenue (ARR), and unit economics over the first three years.

## Customer Growth

| Year | Paying Accounts | Justification                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | 1,600           | Initial rollout across 5 emerging markets (MX, BR, TR, TH, ID), early adoption by export-focused B2B users. High demand for English-language alternatives.               |
| 2    | 15,600          | Localized SEO and paid campaigns in 10+ countries, network effects through client meetings, scaling freemium funnel. Zoom/CRM integrations drive mid-market acquisition. |
| 3    | 72,000          | Viral growth through "speak in your language" UX, deep vertical integrations (ERP, onboarding, legal), reseller programs in EU/MENA.                                     |

## Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

| Year | ARR         | Core Assumptions                                                                                                                |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | $705,600    | 1,600 paying accounts × 1.5 avg licenses × $24.50/mo → conservative freemium conversion + pilot B2B programs.                   |
| 2    | $8,985,600  | 15,600 paying accounts × 2.0 avg licenses × $24.00/mo → improved freemium conversion + active B2B acquisition.                  |
| 3    | $50,760,000 | 72,000 paying accounts × 2.5 avg licenses × $23.50/mo → product maturity, mid-market scaling, upsells (storage, privacy zones). |

## Licenses per Account: Realistic Segmentation

### **Key Insight:** 80%+ will remain single-user, but mid-market growth creates higher average

| Segment              | Y1 Distribution   | Y2 Distribution     | Y3 Distribution   |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Solo/Freelance**   | 83% (1.0 lic/acc) | 81.5% (1.0 lic/acc) | 80% (1.0 lic/acc) |
| **Small Business**   | 15% (2.0 lic/acc) | 15% (3.0 lic/acc)   | 15% (4.0 lic/acc) |
| **Mid-Market**       | 2% (18.5 lic/acc) | 3.5% (21.0 lic/acc) | 5% (22.0 lic/acc) |
| **Weighted Average** | **1.5 lic/acc**   | **2.0 lic/acc**     | **2.5 lic/acc**   |

### **License Growth Logic:**

**Y1:** Pilot adoption — minimal teams testing the product, mostly individual users  
**Y2:** Department rollout — expansion to sales/support departments within existing accounts, mid-market penetration begins  
**Y3:** Department-wide adoption — mid-market companies scale across multiple teams and departments

## CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

| Year | CAC Avg | Rationale                                                                                                                                             |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | $95     | Mix of paid search, founder-led sales, and low-cost pilots. Country-level campaigns with high-intent keywords (e.g., "como hablar ingles reuniones"). |
| 2    | $90     | CAC decreases due to improved funnel metrics, localized onboarding, and content marketing. Organic and referral channels strengthen.                  |
| 3    | $85     | CAC efficiency from reseller programs, partner integrations, and mature attribution modeling.                                                         |

## LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)

| Year | LTV    | Calculation Basis                                                                                     |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | $178.9 | ARPU $36.8/mo × 4.9 mo avg tenure (early users, high churn in freemium segment).                      |
| 2    | $308.0 | ARPU $48.0/mo × 6.4 mo avg tenure (improved retention, B2B clients more sticky).                      |
| 3    | $470.0 | ARPU $58.8/mo × 8.0 mo avg tenure (mid-market dominates; higher ACV + renewals + upsells, 10% churn). |

## Gross Margin

| Year | Margin | Drivers                                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | 73%    | Compute cost of speech translation stack (~$0.08/min/user), bandwidth, minimal infrastructure. Dev amortized.            |
| 2    | 77%    | Model optimization, better GPU utilization, LLM vendor discounts, migration to hybrid infra (edge inference).            |
| 3    | 80%    | In-house speech/LLM models, auto-scaling infra, flat infra per user. B2B features priced higher with low marginal costs. |

## Key Unit Economics Metrics

| Metric                      | Y1     | Y2     | Y3     | Target Value |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| **LTV/CAC**                 | 1.9    | 3.4    | 5.5    | >3.0         |
| **Payback Period**          | 8.5 mo | 5.8 mo | 4.2 mo | <12 mo       |
| **Gross Revenue Retention** | 85%    | 88%    | 90%    | >85%         |
| **Net Revenue Retention**   | 95%    | 115%   | 130%   | >110%        |

## Critical Model Assumptions

### **Pricing Strategy:**

- Slight price optimization over years to increase LTV
- Mid-market tier with premium features in Y2-Y3
- Volume discounts for multi-seat accounts

### **Customer Segmentation Evolution:**

- **Y1:** Focus on SMB early adopters (high churn, rapid adoption)
- **Y2:** Expansion into mid-market through integrations and partnerships
- **Y3:** Mid-market scaling with dedicated customer success and multi-department rollouts

### **Geographic Expansion:**

- Emerging markets first (lower CAC, higher growth rate)
- Developed markets later (higher LTV, more complex acquisition)

## Risks and Mitigation

**Upside scenarios not included:**

- API monetization (planned Y2)
- White-label licensing for mid-market clients
- Marketplace integrations (Zoom App Store, Microsoft Teams)

**Cost assumptions account for:**

- Localized payment methods and currency fluctuations
- Legal compliance (PDPL/GDPR) and support costs
- Competitive pressure on pricing

**Pricing validation:**

- Benchmarked against comparable SaaS tools (Zoom, DeepL Pro, Otter AI)
- Price sensitivity testing in target segments
- Willingness-to-pay analysis through pilot programs

> **Conclusion:** These projections balance growth ambition with disciplined SaaS economics — targeting sustainable LTV/CAC ratios (>5x by Y3) and 80%+ gross margins with realistic customer base segmentation.
