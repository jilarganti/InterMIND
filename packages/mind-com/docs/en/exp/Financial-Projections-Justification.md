# Financial Projections Justification (Yr 1–3) <Badge type="warning" text="draft" />

This document explains the assumptions behind InterMind's projected growth in users, revenue (ARR), and unit economics over the first three years.

## User Growth

| Year | Users   | Justification                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 20,000  | Initial go-to-market pilots across 5 emerging markets (MX, BR, TR, TH, ID), with early adoption from export-focused B2B users. Strong demand for English-language alternatives.     |
| 2    | 120,000 | Localized SEO and paid campaigns in 10+ countries, network effects via client meetings, and scaling of freemium funnel. Planned Zoom/CRM integrations drive mid-market acquisition. |
| 3    | 400,000 | Viral growth via "speak in your language" UX, deeper vertical integrations (ERP, onboarding, legal), and reseller programs in EU/MENA.                                              |

## Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

| Year | ARR     | Assumptions                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | \$2.1M  | Conservative conversion from 20K users: 20% Pro (4K users), \$20/mo/user → \$960K ARR; 50 business deals at \$25K/yr = \$1.25M ARR. |
| 2    | \$11.6M | Improved freemium conversion + B2B acquisition: 30K Pro users (\$7.2M), 170 business accounts (\$25K/yr = \$4.25M).                 |
| 3    | \$38M   | 60K Pro users (\$14.4M), 500 business accounts (\$48K avg ARR = \$24M), plus upsells (storage, privacy zones, support).             |

## CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

| Year | CAC Avg | Rationale                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | \$52    | Mix of paid search, founder-led sales, and low-cost trials. Focused country-level campaigns with high-intent keywords (e.g. "como hablar ingles reuniones"). |
| 2    | \$45    | CAC drops with improved funnel metrics, localized onboarding, and content marketing. Organic and referral channels strengthen.                               |
| 3    | \$39    | CAC efficiency from reseller programs, partner integrations, and mature attribution modeling.                                                                |

## LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)

| Year | LTV   | Basis                                                                                       |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | \$420 | ARPU of \$20/mo × 21 months avg tenure (sticky early adopters, low churn on B2B use cases). |
| 2    | \$480 | 80% Pro users expand seat count in orgs → \$24/mo ARPU × 20 months avg.                     |
| 3    | \$620 | Business accounts dominate; higher ACV + renewals + upsells. Conservative churn (10–12%).   |

## Gross Margin

| Year | Margin | Drivers                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 78%    | Compute cost of speech translation stack (\~\$0.08/min/user), bandwidth, and minimal infra. Dev amortized.              |
| 2    | 82%    | Model optimization, better GPU utilization, LLM vendor discounts, migration to hybrid infra (edge inference).           |
| 3    | 85%    | In-house speech/LLM models, auto-scaling infra, flat infra per user. B2B features priced higher with low marginal cost. |

## Notes

- All numbers are conservative and exclude upside from API monetization (planned Year 2) and enterprise white-label licensing.
- Cost projections factor in localized payment options, legal compliance (PDPL/GDPR), and support cost.
- Pricing assumptions are validated against comparable SaaS tools (Zoom, DeepL Pro, Otter AI).

> These projections balance growth ambition with disciplined SaaS economics — targeting sustainable CAC/LTV ratios (>5x by Year 3) and 80%+ gross margins.
