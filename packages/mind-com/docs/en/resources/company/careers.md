We're building technology that removes language barriers between people. Our product lets people from different countries speak their native language and understand each other naturally.

This isn't a translator. This is a new paradigm for global communication.

## Show Results, Not Credentials

Want to join us? Show us something useful and meaningful you've already built for people.

Education and experience matter, but we care more about: **what real value have you created for people**.

### Your track record is the only reliable measure

We're looking for people who:

**Have already built something.** Code that thousands use. A product that solved a real problem. A system that runs without breaking. A team that delivered results.

**Measure their worth by outcomes.** How many people's lives improved because of your work? How much faster did processes run after your improvements? What problems disappeared after your solutions?

**Think globally.** Have you worked with people from different countries? Solved problems in multicultural environments? Built products for international audiences?

**Tackle hard problems.** Taken on projects where no solution existed? Built something from scratch? Made the impossible look obvious?

## What We're Building

A platform that makes foreign language fluency optional for professional success. Picture this: a Japanese engineer, German manager, and Brazilian designer discussing a project—each speaking their native language, everyone understanding perfectly.

We don't just translate words—we preserve meaning, tone, cultural context. In real-time. No delays. With human-level accuracy.

## Who We're Looking For

### Engineers who build the impossible

- Real-time systems with microsecond latency
- AI models for live speech processing
- Scalable infrastructure for millions of simultaneous calls
- WebRTC optimization for global networks

### Researchers who advance the science

- Neural architectures for cross-language understanding
- Algorithms that preserve emotional nuance in translation
- Methods for adapting to regional dialects and accents
- Unsupervised learning systems for multilingual data

### Designers who solve human problems

- UX for seamless language switching
- Interfaces that work across all cultures
- Visual systems that communicate without words
- Product solutions for global teams

### Leaders who build the future

- International market expansion from zero
- Team building in uncertainty
- Developing "world's first" category products
- Creating new industry standards

## How We Evaluate

**Portfolio beats resume.** Show us GitHub, demos, product links. Tell us the story of a problem you solved and the results you achieved.

**Real projects beat coding tests.** We want to see how you work under real constraints with real deadlines.

**Impact beats activity.** One project that changed thousands of lives beats ten technical exercises.

**Learning ability beats current knowledge.** We're building what doesn't exist yet. Your willingness to learn and adapt is critical.

## The Process

1. **Send links.** Not a resume—links to what you've built. GitHub, products, articles, videos, anything that shows your work.

2. **Tell the story.** What problem did you solve? Why did it matter? How did you measure success? What was the outcome?

3. **Talk with the team.** If your experience interests us, you'll chat with team members. No formal interviews—just conversations about what and how you build.

4. **Work with us.** A short real project so everyone understands how we work together.

**World-scale challenges.** You'll solve problems that affect billions of people.

**World-class team.** Work with top specialists in AI, real-time systems, and global communication.

**Unlimited resources.** Everything you need to build the best product in the category.

**Global impact.** Your work will change how humanity communicates across language boundaries.
