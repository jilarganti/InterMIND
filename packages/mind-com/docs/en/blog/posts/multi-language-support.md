## Supported Languages

Currently, InterMIND supports **19+ languages** including:

- English, Spanish, French, German
- Chinese (Simplified & Traditional)
- Japanese, Korean
- Arabic, Hebrew

- And many more!

## How It Works

Our translation system uses:

1. **AI-powered translations**: Using OpenAI and Anthropic models
2. **Automatic fallback**: If one service fails, we switch to another
3. **RTL support**: Full support for right-to-left languages

## Getting Started with Translations

To access InterMIND in your language:

1. Visit your language-specific URL (e.g., `/es/`, `/fr/`, `/ar/`)
2. The AI chat automatically detects and responds in your language
3. All documentation is available in your preferred language

## For Developers

Adding a new language is simple:

```javascript
// In translateConfig.ts
languages: {
  "pt": "Portuguese",
  // Add your language here
}
```

Then run: `pnpm translate`

Join us in making InterMIND accessible to everyone, regardless of language!
