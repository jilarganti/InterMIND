> Transparency and Honesty — Our Approach to Growth

We believe real progress comes through open comparison with the best solutions on the market. That's why we commissioned independent testing from TestDevLab — a company with 10 years of experience and 500 specialists who test products used by 4.5 billion people worldwide.

## apiMind's Key Victories

### Leader in Extreme Network Conditions

When it comes to truly challenging connectivity conditions — high jitter and latency — **apiMind demonstrates superiority**:

- **+83% better FPS than Google Meet** under high jitter/latency
- **+165% better FPS than Jitsi** in the same conditions
- Maintains video where Jitsi completely shuts it off

This is critical for users with unstable internet, working from remote locations, or relying on mobile connections.

### Most Efficient Resource Usage

apiMind showed the **lowest CPU and GPU consumption** among all tested platforms. This means:

- Extended battery life on laptops
- Ability to run demanding applications simultaneously
- Comfortable performance on mid-range devices

### Stability Under Packet Loss

In packet loss scenarios (typical Wi-Fi network issues):

- **+48% better FPS than Jitsi**
- **+33% better video quality (VMAF)**
- Minimal video freezing

## Areas for Improvement: We're On It

We openly acknowledge areas that need work:

1. **Adaptation to extremely low bandwidth (200kbps)** — Enhanced algorithm prioritizing audio over video already in development
2. **Quality recovery after network improvement** — New dynamic adaptation mechanism coming Q1 2025

## Year-Over-Year Progress: The Numbers Speak for Themselves

Comparing to 2023 results, we've achieved:

- Improved stability under packet loss
- Enhanced video quality in challenging conditions
- Reduced baseline audio delay
- Optimized resource consumption

## Why This Matters for Our Users

### For Enterprise Clients

- **Reliability in critical conditions**: When the CEO calls from an airport with poor Wi-Fi, apiMind keeps the connection alive
- **Resource efficiency**: Less strain on corporate laptops = higher productivity

### For Education

- **Works on lower-end devices**: Students with budget laptops can comfortably participate in classes
- **Resilient to unstable networks**: Rural schools with poor internet stay connected

### For Remote Teams

- **Maximum accessibility**: Work from anywhere in the world, even on mobile data
- **Extended sessions without overheating**: Planning marathons and brainstorming sessions without technical issues

## Our Approach: Focus on Real-World Scenarios

Unlike competitors, we optimize apiMind for **real, not ideal conditions**:

- **Google Meet** works great with good internet, but how many of us always have perfect connectivity?
- **Jitsi** simply disables video when problems arise — we believe showing lower quality video is better than showing none
- **apiMind** is built for the real world — where networks are unstable, devices are diverse, and communication is critical

## What's Next?

We're not stopping here. Our 2025 roadmap includes:

1. **AI-powered Network Adaptation** — Machine learning to predict and preempt network issues
2. **Selective Forward Unit (SFU) 2.0** — Revolutionary architecture for scaling to 1000+ participants
3. **Edge Computing Integration** — Reduced latency through distributed infrastructure

## Try It Yourself

Numbers are good, but personal experience is better. We invite you to:

- [Download the full test report - 2024](/Presentation-TDL-2024.pdf) (90 pages of detailed metrics)
- [Download the full test report - 2023](/Presentation-TDL-2023.pdf) (85 pages of detailed metrics)

## Conclusion

The independent benchmark confirmed: apiMind isn't just "another video calling platform." It's a solution built for the real world where:

- Networks are imperfect
- Devices are diverse
- But communication must always work

We're not perfect, but we're honest. We know our strengths and openly work on improvements. Most importantly — **we're optimized for your real working conditions, not laboratory tests**.
