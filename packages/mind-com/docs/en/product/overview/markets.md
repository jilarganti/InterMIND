¹ **USMCA** — United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement that replaced NAFTA; it enforces strict rules of origin in the auto sector.

## Selection Criteria

1. **Trade Volume** — the larger the turnover, the higher the cost of errors.
2. **English Proficiency** — countries with low C1–C2 share depend on interpretation solutions.
3. **Interpreter Shortage** — daily Zoom calls rarely justify a full‑time human interpreter.

## Strategic Takeaways

- **Top Priority** — US partners and the “factory of the world” cluster; quickest ROI.
- **Second Tier** — EU and MENA; technical accuracy and regulatory risk dominate.
- **UI Localisation** — eight languages (EN, ES, PT, ZH, JA, KO, AR, HI) cover \~85 % of target markets.
- **Compliance** — mind export‑control regimes (EAR, EU Dual‑Use). InterMind purges meeting data after the retention window.
