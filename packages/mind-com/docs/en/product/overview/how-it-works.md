# How AI Real-Time Translation Works

## Speak and Listen in Your Language

InterMind is a multi-user video conferencing platform with **instant bidirectional translation**. Each participant can speak and hear others in **their native language**, creating the effect of natural communication without language barriers.

## How it works:

### 1. **Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text)**

- Streaming recognition using transformer models
- Processing noise and background sounds
- Support for technical terminology and jargon
- Recognition accuracy: **95-98%** for major languages

### 2. **Text Postprocessing (Text Cleanup & Semantic Analysis)**

- **Speech junk removal**: elimination of "uh", "um", repetitions, stuttering
- **Recognition error correction**: context-based correction
- **Punctuation and structuring**: automatic punctuation placement
- **Key meaning extraction**: identification of main and secondary thoughts
- **Utterance segmentation**: breaking into logical blocks for accurate translation
- **Contextual analysis**: linking with previous remarks and overall topic

### 3. **Neural Translation (Neural Translation)**

- Context-dependent translation with meaning preservation
- Understanding of idioms, metaphors, and cultural references
- Speech style adaptation (formal/informal)
- Preserving emotional coloring of utterances

### 4. **Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech)**

- Natural intonation and speech rhythm
- Preserving pauses and accents of the original
- Male/female voice selection
- Speed and tone adjustment

All this happens with **latency under 3 seconds** — matching the speed of professional simultaneous interpreters[^1] [^2].

## Practical Advantages

### Speech Processing Quality:

- **Noise filtering**: automatic removal of coughing, laughter, background conversations
- **Smart punctuation**: recognition of intonational pauses and logical emphasis
- **Error correction**: fixing typos and recognition inaccuracies on the fly
- **Semantic compression**: preserving meaning while removing redundancy

### For Business:

- **Global teams**: eliminating language barriers in international teams
- **Client meetings**: direct communication with clients without interpreter services
- **Training and presentations**: simultaneous content delivery in multiple languages
- **Cost savings**: reducing interpreter costs by up to **80%**

### For Users:

- **Naturalness**: speak as usual, think in your native language
- **Privacy**: no third parties (interpreters)
- **Accessibility**: 24/7 without advance planning
- **Scalability**: from 2 to 1000+ participants

## Better than Human — and Improving Every Day

### Technology Stack:

- **LLM providers**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini (regional selection)
- **Regionality**: compliance with local privacy requirements (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Continuous learning**: analysis of 10,000+ hours of multilingual meetings monthly
- **Specialization**: models for specific industries (medicine, law, finance, IT)

### Translation Quality:

- **Accuracy**: 94-97% correctness for business conversations
- **Context**: understanding context throughout the entire meeting
- **Terminology**: adaptive dictionaries for each industry
- **Feedback**: user quality rating system

[^1]: Standard latency for human simultaneous translation is ~2–3 seconds.

[^2]: Based on current progress in AI translation, we expect that within 2–3 years, models will consistently outperform the best human translators — including specialized areas such as law, finance, healthcare, and engineering.
