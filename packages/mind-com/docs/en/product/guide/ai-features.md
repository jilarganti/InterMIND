# AI Features

This section outlines the functionalities of the Voice Assistant (Jarvis), Online Voice Translation, and AI Assistant available during meetings.

## Online Voice Translation

This functionality provides real-time translations for participants who enable it, ensuring that the experience remains unaffected for other attendees at the meeting. Moreover, users possess the flexibility to modify the translation language at any moment via the Settings panel.

The voice translator is automatically activated upon entering a meeting; however, the translation process will only commence if the interface and translation languages of the participants differ. In instances where all participants have chosen the same language, no translation will occur.

Once a participant alters their interface and translation language, all other participants will begin to hear the translation in the language they have selected within the meeting settings.

Additionally, participants have the option to adjust the volume of the original audio from other attendees through the meeting settings, allowing them to concentrate solely on the translation.

### Key Features

- Real-time voice dubbing in the selected language
- Personal translation settings (does not affect other participants)
- Ability to change translation language at any time through the Settings panel
- Available to all participant types (Host, Moderator, Participant, Guest)

### How to Enable

Translation can be activated by any participant by adjusting their language settings in the Settings panel during the meeting.

### Customization

- Each participant can set their own preferred translation language
- Translation preferences are saved in user settings for future meetings
