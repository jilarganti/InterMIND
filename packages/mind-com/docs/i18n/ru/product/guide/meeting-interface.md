## Main Interface Layout

Upon attending a meeting—whether as a Host, Moderator, Participant, or Guest—the screen layout varies based on your role (refer to the User Roles section). The layout includes:

- Change the Translator language to facilitate communication among participants speaking different languages

## Participant Interaction Features

Participants can engage actively in the meeting using several available tools within the interface:

- **Lower Hand**: Hosts and Moderators can manually lower a participant's raised hand, maintaining order during discussions
