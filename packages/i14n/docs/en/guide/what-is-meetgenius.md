# What is MeetGenius AI?

MeetGenius AI is a revolutionary video conferencing platform with integrated artificial intelligence, designed to solve five critical problems in modern business communications.

Unlike standard video meeting solutions, MeetGenius AI analyzes the context of all corporate communications: past meetings, documents, correspondence, and tasks. This allows the system to not just facilitate, but qualitatively improve all aspects of meetings.

Our AI assistant works as an invisible participant in every meeting, remembering everything, analyzing what's happening in real-time, and providing support exactly when it's needed—without overloading participants with unnecessary information.

Four key functions of MeetGenius AI form a comprehensive ecosystem that makes your meetings more productive, honest, and results-oriented:

1. **TruthMeet** — real-time fact-checking based on corporate data and publicly available information
2. **DataBoost** — intelligent conversation enrichment with relevant information
3. **TaskTracker** — identification of main objectives with task decomposition for execution control
4. **MeetingRater** — meeting effectiveness analytics to create constructive social pressure
5. **BabelBreak** — synchronous multilingual translation with preserved intonation

All these functions are implemented with the highest data protection standards, including end-to-end encryption, detailed access control, and full compliance with international security and privacy standards.
