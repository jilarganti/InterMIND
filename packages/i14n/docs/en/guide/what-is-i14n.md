# What is i14n?

i14n (pronounced "interpretation") is our innovative approach to breaking down language barriers in real-time video communication. The name itself is a technical numeronym - similar to i18n (internationalization) - where 14 represents the 14 letters between "i" and "n" in the word "interpretation".

## Breaking Down the Concept

i14n is a seamless integration of synchronous interpretation capabilities within video conferencing. Unlike traditional translation services that work with text or require separate interpretation channels, i14n delivers real-time spoken language translation directly within your video meeting experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-time interpretation**: Experience fluid multilingual conversations without awkward pauses
- **Multiple language support**: Connect with participants across numerous language combinations
- **Seamless integration**: No additional software or hardware required beyond our platform
- **Meeting continuity**: Maintain natural conversation flow without disruption
- **Accessibility**: Make your meetings truly global with instant language accessibility

## How It Works

Our advanced AI-powered system processes speech in real-time, analyzing both linguistic content and contextual cues to deliver accurate interpretations through your preferred audio channel. Meeting participants can select their preferred language and hear the conversation as if it were originally conducted in that language.

i14n represents our commitment to removing language as a barrier to global collaboration, making truly international meetings accessible to everyone.
