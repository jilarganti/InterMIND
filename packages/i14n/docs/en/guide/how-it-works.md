## 🔧 How It Works

> [!note] Real-time interpretation. Native-level understanding. No subtitles. No lag.

### 🎙 Speak in any language — hear your own

InterMind is a multi-user video conferencing platform with **instant, bidirectional interpretation**.
Each participant can speak in their **own native language** — at any time — and hear everyone else in **their chosen language**.

No need to wait for turns or rely on subtitles.

### 🧠 Real-time translation powered by deep context

Behind the scenes:

1. **Speech-to-text**: Every voice input is transcribed live.
2. **Neural translation**: Transcripts are translated into your native language — with tone and intent preserved.
3. **Voice synthesis**: The translated message is spoken in real time, using your voice settings.

All this happens with a **latency under 3 seconds** — equivalent to a human simultaneous interpreter[^1] [^2].

[^1]: Industry benchmark for real-time human interpretation latency is \~2–3 seconds.

[^2]: Based on current progress in AI interpretation, we expect that within 2–3 years, models will consistently outperform top-tier human interpreters — including in specialized domains like law, finance, healthcare, and engineering.

### 📈 Better than human — and improving every day

InterMind enables seamless integration with leading LLM providers — selected based on your chosen privacy region.
We don’t train our own models, but we fine-tune interpretation settings using real-world multilingual meetings to ensure relevance and clarity.

### 🧩 Deep memory = deep understanding

Unlike generic translators, InterMind **remembers your meetings**:

- Context of prior conversations
- Agendas, participants, project-specific terms
- Outcomes, tasks, and decisions

Your AI interpreter evolves with your team. It understands not just the language — but **the topic, project, and personalities** involved.

Confidentiality is always your choice.

### 🔐 Privacy by Design

Use [Region-Segmented Privacy Architecture](privacy-architecture) to decide where and how your data is processed.

- Turn memory **on/off** at any time
- Wipe AI memory after meetings
- Select privacy zones (US, EU, Asia) for regulatory compliance

All audio/video routing is handled by our proprietary **Mind API**, built in-house to ensure performance and data sovereignty.
