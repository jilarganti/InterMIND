## Meetings List

Each entry in your meeting history comprises:

- **Date** (including Time)

- **# Pax (Participants)**
- **Recording**
- **Title**
- **Actions**
  - Delete

## Search & Action Buttons

To facilitate efficient management of your past meetings, the History page incorporates:

### Search Bar

This feature allows you to find meetings by keywords in the Title or Transcript, or by the exact Room or Participant. Filters can be combined for more precise results.

### Room ID

Clicking the Room ID link organizes the list to display only meetings associated with the same Room ID.

### # Pax (Participants)

Clicking this will open a dropdown listing all participants.

Some Action Buttons can be found hidden under the three-dot menu located on the right side.

### Available Actions

#### Delete

When this action is clicked, users will receive a notification prompting them to confirm deletion by clicking the **Yes, delete** button or to cancel the operation by clicking the **Cancel** button. Deleted meetings will no longer be visible to any participants. Only Hosts or Moderators possess the authority to delete a meeting.

#### Share

Users will receive a pop-up notification stating the **Link copied to clipboard!** which allows them to share this link with any authorized users.

#### Join

This action permits any user with the meeting record on the History page to join the meeting, resulting in the creation of a new record with the same Room ID.

## Meeting Details

Each meeting row features content-related tabs:
