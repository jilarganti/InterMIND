> Transparency and Honesty — Our Approach to Growth

We believe real progress comes through open comparison with the best solutions on the market. That's why we commissioned independent testing from TestDevLab — a company with 10 years of experience and 500 specialists who test products used by 4.5 billion people worldwide.

## apiMind's Key Strengths

### Superior Performance in Jitter/Latency Conditions

When networks experience high jitter and latency, **apiMind shows notable advantages**:

- **Maintains functional video** when Google Meet drops to 0.24 FPS and Jitsi disables video entirely
- **+165% better FPS than Jitsi** under high jitter/latency conditions
- Better video continuity compared to competitors in timing-sensitive scenarios

This is critical for users with unstable connections or those working through VPNs and remote locations.

### Strong Packet Loss Handling

In packet loss scenarios (common in Wi-Fi networks):

- **+48% better FPS than Jitsi**
- **+33% better video quality (VMAF) than Jitsi**
- Comparable performance to Google Meet with minimal freezing

### Optimized Network Utilization

apiMind demonstrates:

- Higher receiver bitrate on unlimited networks (optimized for quality when bandwidth allows)
- Efficient adaptation strategies in constrained environments
- Balanced resource allocation between audio and video

## Areas for Improvement: We're Transparent

We openly acknowledge areas that need work:

1. **Low bandwidth adaptation (200kbps)** — Currently experiencing audio drops and FPS degradation to ~5 FPS (Google Meet maintains ~17 FPS)
2. **Quality recovery after network improvement** — System doesn't consistently return to original quality (50% recovery rate in tests)
3. **Baseline delays** — Higher audio/video delays compared to competitors in optimal conditions

## Year-Over-Year Progress: Measurable Improvements

Comparing to 2023 results, we've achieved:

- Better stability during packet loss conditions
- Improved video quality at 20% packet loss
- Reduced baseline audio delay
- More consistent frame rate maintenance

## Why This Matters for Our Users

### For Enterprise Clients

- **Resilience in challenging conditions**: Maintains connection quality when network timing is inconsistent
- **Predictable performance**: Consistent behavior across different network scenarios

### For Education

- **Handles network instability**: Better performance with jitter/latency common in institutional networks
- **Maintains connection**: Keeps video active when others might disconnect

### For Remote Teams

- **VPN-friendly**: Superior handling of latency introduced by secure connections
- **International calls**: Better performance across long-distance connections with natural latency

## Real-World Performance Context

Our optimization priorities reflect real usage patterns:

- **apiMind** excels when network timing is inconsistent (jitter/latency)
- **Google Meet** performs best with stable, high-bandwidth connections
- **Jitsi** offers open-source flexibility but may disable video under stress

Each platform has its strengths — we focus on maintaining communication when network conditions are unpredictable.

## Our Development Roadmap

We're actively working on:

1. **Enhanced Bandwidth Adaptation** — Improved audio prioritization and frame rate management at low bandwidth
2. **Dynamic Quality Recovery** — Faster restoration to optimal quality when network conditions improve
3. **Latency Optimization** — Reducing baseline delays while maintaining stability

## Experience the Difference Yourself

Data tells a story, but your own experience writes the final chapter:

- [Download the full test report - 2023](/Presentation-TDL-2023.pdf) (85 pages of detailed metrics)

## Conclusion

The independent benchmark provides valuable insights into real-world performance. apiMind shows **strong performance in challenging network timing conditions** and competitive packet loss handling, while we continue improving bandwidth adaptation and recovery mechanisms.

> We're committed to transparency about both our strengths and areas for improvement. These results guide our development priorities as we build for real-world conditions.

_Research conducted by TestDevLab (Latvia) in July 2024. Methodology: 3 participants, Windows/Chrome, testing under dynamic network conditions with each phase lasting 60 seconds — bandwidth (Unlimited→2M→500K→200K→500K→2M→Unlimited), packet loss (0%→10%→20%→20%→20%→10%→0%), and jitter/latency (0/0→100/30→500/90→1500/270→500/90→100/30→0/0 ms)._
