# UAE residency and work visas

Overseas professionals who want to live and work in the UAE must obtain a residency visa and a work permit (also known as the labor card).

> [!NOTE] ðŸ’š A foreign national is entitled to a residency visa in the UAE after:
>
> - Business formation in the UAE;
> - Becoming a shareholder of a UAE company;
> - Purchasing real estate in the UAE;
> - Being employed within the UAE.

Golden Fish assists clients in obtaining work and residency permits in the UAE.

## Overview of Residency Visas

Securing a two-year residency visa in the UAE is relatively simpler than in other jurisdictions. Once obtained, it can be easily renewed.

Individuals holding a UAE residency visa can sponsor their family members, provided they meet specific requirements such as a minimum monthly income threshold, suitable housing arrangements, and obtaining a health insurance policy for each family member.

Five- and ten-year residency visas are also available.

Foreign investors with free zone companies must consider that their quota for employee visas is directly proportional to the size of office premises leased. For every 10 sqm of office space, one employee visa is granted. The standard rule of thumb in many free zones is 10 sqm per visa.

UAE offshore companies are not eligible to apply for employment visas.

## Visas for Professionals

Entrepreneurs relocating to the UAE to manage their businesses can apply for a two-year residence visa.

Entrepreneurs with a project worth a minimum of AED 500,000 or those with specially accredited business incubators in the UAE can be granted a five-year residency visa.

Real estate investors who own property or properties with a total value of at least AED 2 million can get a five-year renewable Golden Visa.

> [!NOTE] ðŸ’š Investors in the UAE can secure a Golden Visa for up to 10 years without a sponsor by fulfilling one of the following criteria:
>
> - Depositing AED 2 million in a UAE-accredited investment fund;
> - Holding a commercial or industrial license with a declared capital of at least AED 2 million;
> - Proving annual government payments of AED 250,000 through the FTA.

Specialists with exceptional expertise in specific industries, such as medicine, science, or research, are also eligible for up to a ten-year residency visa.

## Employment Visas

All foreign workers require a residence visa and a "labour card". Expatriate employee visas are sponsored by their employer. The employee must:

- Undertake medical examinations and record biometrics in the UAE
- Supply copies of the signed employment contract
- Provide UAE embassy-attested academic qualifications and professional qualifications (for job titles of Managers or above)
- Provide an employer sponsorship letter

Employment visas are issued by the Ministry of Labour, while residence visas are issued by the Department of Immigration. The employee must always carry the labor card, which also serves as an identity card.

## Dependent Visas for Family Members

Golden Fish will happily apply for family visas once our client's entrepreneur or employment visa is secured.

The estimated timeframe to secure the same is approximately three weeks per dependent visa, depending on factors such as processing delays or missing documentation.

Dependent visas can only be applied after the principal sponsor has obtained the following:

- An [Emirates ID](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/emirates-id) card ![ID Card](/img/ILONMASKID.webp)
- A signed lease agreement for a UAE residential property large enough to accommodate all dependents
- The Ejari registration for this residential property

## UAE Employment Visa Process (Step-by-Step Guide)

Before submitting a visa application to the government, applicants must ensure their passport has at least two blank pages and a validity of at least six months.

Once engaged, Golden Fish will provide you with a complete list of required documents. Depending on the job title, UAE embassy-attested documents, such as academic qualifications, professional licenses, or experience certificates, may be required.

During the visa application process, applicants will:

- Need to travel to Dubai and stay in the country for seven complete business days
- Undergo a medical examination in Dubai
- Record their biometrics with the government authority
- Secure local health insurance

The employee visa application process takes approximately four weeks from the moment the visa is submitted. Dependent visa applications take three weeks.

If a visa application is commenced while the applicant is in the UAE, the applicant must remain within the country during the entire visa application process. If the visa application is made when the applicant is abroad, our client may only enter the UAE after receiving the entry permit.

If the entry permit is secured while the applicant is abroad, the applicant must enter Dubai within two months from the date the entry permit is issued.

The final decision rests with the government, and while we cannot guarantee success, we maximize the chances of approval through thorough preparation. We ensure the preparation and submission of a high-quality immigration visa application that maximizes the likelihood of approval.

> [!NOTE] ðŸ’š Once the visa is issued, the applicant must visit the UAE at least once every 180 days to avoid cancellation.
> Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to automatic visa cancellation, which can result in the need to reapply for the visa, incurring additional time and costs.

From 1 January 2023, all employees in the UAE are required to obtain job loss insurance. This insurance provides financial assistance to employees who lose their jobs due to termination by their employers (except for gross negligence). The annual insurance cost varies between AED 60 and AED 120, depending on the employee's basic salary. This insurance is included when our clients engage us to secure their UAE employment and residency visas.

## Involuntary Loss of Employment Scheme

As of 1 January 2023, all UAE employees must have job loss insurance. This may offer financial support to employees who are terminated by their employers, excluding cases of gross negligence. The annual cost of this insurance ranges from AED 60 to AED 120, based on the employee's basic salary. We include this insurance automatically when our clients engage us for UAE employment and residency visas.

## Health Insurance

Before securing a UAE visa, visa candidates must secure local health insurance. Our fees cover securing basic health insurance.
