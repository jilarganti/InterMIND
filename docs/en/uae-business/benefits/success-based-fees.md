# Zero Upfront Fees – Pay Only After Approval

## Our Unique Payment Approach

In the world of UAE business services and migration processes, most companies require full upfront payment, including both government fees and agent fees. They promise to refund only the agent fees in case of rejection, while government fees are non-refundable.

## How We're Different

Our business model is radically different from standard market practice:

1. **Only Government Fees Upfront** – we only ask clients to pay the mandatory government fees needed to initiate the process
2. **Our Service Fees Only After Approval** – we invoice for our professional services only after receiving a positive decision

3. **No Risk of Lost Money** – you don't lose money on agent commissions in case of rejection

## Benefits of Our Approach

- **Minimal Initial Investment** – you don't need to advance large sums
- **Distributed Financial Burden** – pay the main portion only when results are guaranteed
- **Complete Transparency** – clear separation between government fees and our services
- **Confidence in Quality** – we're so confident in our success that we're willing to wait for payment until results are delivered

## How It Works

1. Initial consultation (free)
2. Payment of government fees only
3. We handle all document preparation and submission work
4. After approval, you receive an invoice for our services
5. Process completion and receipt of necessary documents
