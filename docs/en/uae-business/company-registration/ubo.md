# UAE Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO): Complete Guide 2025

The UAE government introduced new regulations in August 2020 requiring companies registered and licensed in the UAE to maintain and submit registers of their:

- **Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs or Real Beneficiaries)**: Identifies individuals who ultimately own or control the company, helping prevent misuse for illicit activities.
- **Shareholders**: Records the ownership structure and equity distribution among the company's investors.
- **Nominee Directors**: Ensures transparency regarding individuals appointed to act on behalf of others in managing the company.

The legislation was introduced to:

- **Combat tax avoidance and criminal activity** by ensuring the real owners of companies are known, reducing the risk of misuse for illegal purposes.
- **Provide greater transparency** to the UAE’s business sector by making ownership structures clear, which helps foster trust and compliance.

## Who is an Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO)?

- A **UBO** is a natural person(s) who owns or controls at least 25% of a company’s shares, directly or indirectly (including ownership through other entities). Companies can have more than one UBO.
- If no such person is identified, the **UBO** naturally exercises control over the company.
- In the absence of any of the above, the real beneficiary is the company's **senior manager**.

## What UAE Companies Do These New Regulations Apply To?

- **All**:

  - Mainland companies
  - Commercial free zone companies
  - Offshore companies

- **Exceptions**:
  - **Companies established in the UAE’s financial free zones** (Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)): These zones have their own regulatory frameworks that ensure compliance with international standards.
  - **Companies wholly owned directly or indirectly by the federal or local government and their subsidiaries**: These entities are typically exempt due to their public ownership and the level of oversight already in place.

## What Registers Do UAE Companies Need to Maintain?

The company must maintain:

- A **Register of Beneficial Owners**
- A **Register of Shareholders or Partners**
- A **Register of Nominee Directors**

## What Information Should Be Included in These Registers?

- The **Registers** should include:

  - Name
  - Nationality
  - Passport details
  - Date and place of birth
  - Address
  - Date when the individual became a UBO and/or the date upon which the individual ceases to be a natural beneficiary

  - Number of shares held by each shareholder
  - Voting rights of the shares
  - Date of acquisition of shares
  - Information on all parties

- The company is also required to:

  - **Appoint and disclose details** of a natural person (known as an authorized agent) residing in the UAE who is authorized to disclose the company’s data and information required under the resolution.
  - **Notify the Registrar** of any change or amendment to the information provided within 15 days of the change or amendment.

- The **Registers must be**:
  - Maintained throughout the life of the company and for five years after its closure.
  - Kept **confidential** by the Registrar: Confidentiality is crucial to protect sensitive company information and ensure trust in the regulatory process, reducing the risk of misuse or unauthorized access.

## What Happens if the Company Fails to Meet These Requirements?
