:::details UAE Business Setup FAQ

### General Ownership Requirements

**Will there be restrictions on ownership if foreigners set up a UAE company?**

2. No obligation to hire staff.
3. No customs duties on goods entering or leaving the zone.
4. High-quality infrastructure.

**Do I need to rent premises for my company?**

The requirements differ based on the type of company:

| Company Type      | Office Requirement                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free Zone Company | A lease agreement for office premises or a flexi-desk is required before incorporation. |
| Mainland Company  | Only a virtual or registered address is needed.                                         |
| Offshore Company  | Only a virtual or registered address is needed.                                         |

Yes, most entities will require audited financial statements.

Corporate Income Tax (CIT) has been implemented in the UAE at a standard rate of 9%.
