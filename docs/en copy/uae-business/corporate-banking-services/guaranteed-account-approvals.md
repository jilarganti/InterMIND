# Guaranteed corporate bank account approvals in 2025

Golden Fish has assisted multinational clients in securing approvals for multi-currency corporate bank accounts. We are the experts in opening such accounts in the UAE.

Opening international multi-currency corporate bank accounts can be challenging. For this reason, multinational clients engage Golden Fish to provide guaranteed solutions.

## Our Guarantee

**Two-Month Guarantee**: Provided all requirements are met, our clients should expect to receive multi-currency corporate bank account numbers from at least one bank within two months of submitting an accurate and complete application.

**Three-Month Guarantee**: Within three months of submitting an accurate and complete application, our clients should expect to receive multi-currency corporate bank account numbers from at least two banks.

**No Travel Requirement**: For most of our multinational clients, the bank signatory does not need to travel to meet the bank officer.

:::details Our Strategy

## Our Strategy

To maximize the probability of successful and timely approval of a multi-currency corporate bank account, Golden Fish employs the following practical strategies:

**Quality Business Plan Preparation**: Together with our clients, we prepare a quality business plan that clearly explains the existing and future business activities, including:

1. Products and services
2. International customers and suppliers
3. Details of shareholders, directors, and beneficial owners

**Comprehensive Due Diligence**: With our clients' cooperation, we collect all required Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence documentation. Providing the bank's internal Legal and Compliance Department with abundant, transparent supporting documents helps bank officers assess the risk profile of a potential new customer.

**Tailored Strategy Document**: We email clients a tailored multi-currency corporate bank account opening strategy document.

**Leveraging Our Banking Network**: We supply our bank officers with the business plan and all relevant KYC due diligence documents. We secure written confirmation from multiple banks—a welcome email inviting our clients to submit a formal corporate bank account opening application.

**Regular Communication Updates**: Each week, our staff includes our multinational clients in email communications with international banks. This allows our clients to see progress in real-time, including engagement issues, solutions, and bank feedback.

**Travel Exemption Negotiation**: Our staff aggressively and skillfully negotiate a travel exemption for the bank signatory with international banks.

**First Account Approval**: Provided all requirements are met, we expect to approve at least one multi-currency corporate bank account within two months.

**Additional Accounts**: Our multinational clients advise us on how many additional multi-currency corporate bank accounts they need and subsequently settle the remaining engagement fees.

**Second or Third Account Approval**: Provided all goes well, we expect approval for a second or third bank account within three months.

**Complete Banking Package**: After securing all the corporate bank accounts our clients require, Golden Fish will courier a complete banking package to our clients for their e-banking access.

:::details Common Banking Challenges for International Entrepreneurs

## Common Banking Challenges for International Entrepreneurs

#### Major Banks (Tier 1) - Key Limitations:

1. Reluctance to Work with International Clients

   - Prefer established businesses with substantial local presence
   - Focus on companies operating in the bank's home country
   - Less welcoming to non-resident SMEs and startups

2. Strict Location Requirements
   - Strong preference for companies incorporated in the bank's operating country
   - Higher scrutiny of foreign-registered businesses

#### Solutions and Considerations:

1. Alternative Banking Options
   - Tier 2 banks may provide more flexible solutions
   - PSP (Payment Service Provider) solutions available worldwide
   - These alternatives can better suit international entrepreneurs

#### Important Notice for Client Expectations:

When pursuing multi-currency corporate bank account opening, various challenges may arise. It's crucial to understand these limitations upfront to set appropriate expectations and identify the most suitable banking solution for each client's specific situation.

## What you should know about international banking

Due to low global interest rates, international banks make minimal profits from current accounts, reducing their appetite for new multi-currency corporate bank account applications, which leads to higher rejection rates.

Because of the above, customer demand for new corporate bank accounts is higher than the supply of international banking solutions. Consequently, international banks choose low-risk customers that meet all criteria for minimizing risk. These typically include companies registered in the same country, with local staff, office premises, and local customer and supplier invoices. For example, banks welcome multi-currency corporate bank account opening applications from a company registered in the same country with i) local staff and office premises and ii) local customer and Supplier invoices;

Unfortunately, international banks classify the following quality Clients as High-Risk Customers due to perceived compliance and regulatory risks associated with these scenarios:

- A foreign company is opening a multi-currency corporate bank account in a different country. For example, a Singaporean LLC wishing to open a multi-currency corporate bank account in Germany;
- A tax-neutral entity is opening a multi-currency corporate bank account with an international bank. For example, a BVI IBC wants a multi-currency corporate bank account with HSBC London;
- A foreign company with business relationships with high-risk jurisdictions, i.e., Client/Supplier who is from or in any country or jurisdiction known to have inadequate measures to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, sanctioned jurisdictions, and jurisdiction identified as having significant corruption and/or criminal activity;

When dealing with international banks, the bank's front office relationship manager is willing to help Golden Fish and our multi-national Clients.

The role of this bank officer is to collect information and ensure an accurate and complete multi-currency corporate bank account opening application is submitted to the bank's in-house Legal and Compliance Department.

Unfortunately, the bank's in-house Legal and Compliance Department has the ultimate approval power over new multi-currency corporate bank account applications. This Department is highly risk-averse and often lacks touch with commercial reality. Furthermore, banking regulations do not allow the in-house Legal and Compliance Department to speak to customers or Golden Fish. All communications must go through the front office bank officer. Consequently, our Clients and our team often do not get the opportunity to communicate directly with the bank's decision-makers to adequately explain their business and the risks the bank perceives.

Upon successful multi-currency corporate bank account approval and once the business relationship with the customer has been established, the bank's in-house Legal and Compliance Department continues to monitor the customer's corporate bank account. Therefore, Golden Fish recommends our Clients put in place internal systems and processes, such as regular internal audits, transaction monitoring tools, and compliance training for staff, to ensure continuing compliance with each banking transaction of their corporate bank accounts to maintain the stable and healthy corporate relationship with the bank;
