## Tax Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing Considerations

**VAT Returns**: Filed monthly or quarterly, depending on turnover, and due by the 28th of the month following the reporting period.

**Annual Financial Statements**: All companies must prepare financial statements as per IFRS/IAS standards. These must be filed with UAE authorities. Clients may need an annual audit, depending on the Emirate.

## UAE VAT and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Requirements

### VAT Registration

VAT registration is mandatory when a business's taxable supplies and imports, including goods and services sold or imported, exceed the threshold of `AED 375,000`. However, businesses can also voluntarily register for VAT if the sum of their taxable supplies, imports, or expenses surpasses `AED 187,500`.

### Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Registration

All taxable entities must register for UAE Corporate Tax within three months of company or branch registration. This includes complying with the corresponding implementing decisions. The UAE Corporate Tax registration requirement encompasses all businesses, regardless of whether they are subject to a `0%` or `9%` tax rate.

### VAT Filing

With a general VAT rate of `5%`, businesses in the UAE must file their VAT returns with the Federal Tax Authority within 28 days after the end of their respective tax period. The specific tax period depends on the business type:

- **Monthly** for businesses with a turnover of `AED 150 million` or more.
- **Quarterly** for businesses with a turnover below `AED 150 million`.

This filing schedule helps determine the timeframe for tax calculation and payment.

### CIT Filings

Under the UAE Corporate Tax Law, all taxable persons must file and, where necessary, pay corporate tax returns within nine months after the close of the applicable tax period. This requirement applies regardless of whether the entities are taxed at a `0%` or `9%` rate.

### Financial Statements

Companies must submit their financial statements within 90 days after the end of each financial year. Depending on the company size or type, these financial statements may need to be audited, while some companies may qualify for exemptions. The first financial year post-incorporation must be between six and 18 months. Companies may request an extension for the submission of these reports, and depending on the location of the company, an audit may be required.

### Penalty for Non-Submission of Tax Documents

| Penalty Type                                                                                               | Penalty Amount                                                                                                                                   |

## UAE Company Taxation and Compliance Guide

### UAE Company Tax Exemption Package

**Double Taxation Avoidance**: The UAE has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) with more than 90 countries, including Canada, China, France, India, and Singapore. These agreements help businesses avoid being taxed twice on the same income, thus reducing tax burdens, enhancing profitability, and encouraging cross-border investment and trade.

**Taxation of Supplies**: All supplies of goods and services made in the UAE are taxable. However, over 20 free zones are treated as designated free zones under VAT law, subject to specific conditions, including geographic fencing, customs monitoring, internal procedures for goods management, and compliance with Federal Tax Authority (FTA) procedures:

- **Geographic Area**: Must be a specific fenced area.
- **Security and Customs**: Customs controls must monitor the entry and exit of individuals and goods.
- **Internal Procedures**: Keeping, storing, and processing goods must follow specific procedures.
- **FTA Compliance**: The operator must comply with Federal Tax Authority (FTA) procedures.
- **VAT Application**: The area is treated as outside the UAE for VAT purposes only when all criteria are met; otherwise, regular VAT rules apply.

### UAE Company Legal and Compliance Considerations

**Dual Legal System**: The UAE legal framework combines Islamic Shariah law and conventional law, ensuring a flexible and comprehensive legal environment for businesses.

**Foreign Company Setup**: Foreign companies can establish a branch or wholly-owned subsidiary in mainland and free trade zones without appointing a UAE national sponsor. Setting up in a mainland zone allows direct access to the UAE market and flexibility in business across the Emirates, while free trade zones offer benefits like 100% foreign ownership, tax exemptions, and simplified customs procedures.

**Business License Renewal**: A UAE LLC must renew its business license annually to remain compliant and operational.

**Restrictions on Activities**: Different classified activities (e.g., trading and services) cannot be combined under one license to maintain clear business categorization.

**Management and Incorporation**:

- Companies must designate a manager via either the Memorandum of Association (MOA) or a separate management contract.
- Directors control daily operations; specific permits and licenses may be required depending on the business type (e.g., healthcare, medical equipment).
- Companies must establish an office within the same emirate as incorporation; operations in other free zones require additional licenses.

**Disclosure of Beneficial Owners**: All UAE companies must submit a declaration of [Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs)](./ubo.md), shareholders, and nominee directors.

**Economic Substance Requirements (ESR)**:

- Companies engaged in relevant activities must file an ESR notification within six months of the financial year-end and submit an ESR report within 12 months. Non-compliance could lead to fines of up to `AED 20,000`.
<!-- - Refer to the [UAE Economic Substance page](#) for more details. -->

**Company Deregistration**: The deregistration process takes a minimum of six months and requires a resident company secretary and a registered office during this period. The steps involved include notifying the relevant authorities, settling all outstanding liabilities, canceling visas, obtaining clearance from various government departments (e.g., immigration, labor), publishing a notice of deregistration, and submitting final audited financial statements. Compliance with legal requirements is essential throughout the process to avoid penalties or delays.

**Membership in Global Organizations**: The UAE is a member of various international organizations and treaties, including:

- [World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)](https://www.wipo.int/portal/)
- [World Trade Organization (WTO)](https://www.wto.org/)
- [Paris Convention](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/summary_paris.html)
- [Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)](https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/pct_contracting_states.html)
- [WIPO Copyright Treaty](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/ShowResults?start_year=ANY&end_year=ANY&search_what=B&code=ALL&bo_id=17)
- [WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/ShowResults?start_year=ANY&end_year=ANY&search_what=C&code=ALL&treaty_id=20)
- [Rome Convention](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/rome/summary_rome.html)

**Wages Protection System (WPS)**: Businesses in the UAE must register for the [WPS](https://www.centralbank.ae/en/our-operations/payments-and-settlements/uae-wages-protection-system-uaewps/), which typically takes `four weeks`. This system ensures timely and fair wage payments to employees.

**End of Service Benefit**: Expatriates are entitled to end-of-service benefits as part of their employment package, ensuring compensation after the completion of their service.

**Job Loss Insurance**: All employees must obtain [job loss insurance](https://www.iloe.ae/), which costs `AED 60` to `AED 120` per year based on salary. This insurance provides financial assistance to employees who lose their jobs due to reasons other than gross negligence.

**Emiratisation**: Mainland employers with over `49 employees` must employ a certain percentage of UAE nationals, increasing yearly by `2%` until 2026. Non-compliance leads to fines of `AED 6,000` monthly. The government offers support initiatives, such as wage subsidies and training programs, to assist businesses in meeting these requirements. Additionally, companies that comply with Emiratisation targets may receive priority in government contracts and reduced fees for various government services.

| Number of skilled workers | Number of UAE nationals to be hired each year  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 0-49                      | Exempted                                       |
| 50 and above              | One UAE nationals for every 50 skilled workers |
