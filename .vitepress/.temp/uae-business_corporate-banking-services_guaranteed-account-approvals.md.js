Consequently, international banks choose low-risk customers that meet all criteria for minimizing risk. These typically include companies registered in the same country, with local staff, office premises, and local customer and supplier invoices. For example, banks welcome multi-currency corporate bank account opening applications from a company registered in the same country with i) local staff and office premises and ii) local customer and Supplier invoices;</p><p>Unfortunately, international banks classify the following quality Clients as High-Risk Customers due to perceived compliance and regulatory risks associated with these scenarios:</p><ul><li>A foreign company is opening a multi-currency corporate bank account in a different country. For example, a Singaporean LLC wishing to open a multi-currency corporate bank account in Germany;</li><li>A tax-neutral entity is opening a multi-currency corporate bank account with an international bank. For example, a BVI IBC wants a multi-currency corporate bank account with HSBC London;</li><li>A foreign company with business relationships with high-risk jurisdictions, i.e., Client/Supplier who is from or in any country or jurisdiction known to have inadequate measures to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, sanctioned jurisdictions, and jurisdiction identified as having significant corruption and/or criminal activity;</li></ul><p>When dealing with international banks, the bank&#39;s front office relationship manager is willing to help Golden Fish and our multi-national Clients.</p><p>The role of this bank officer is to collect information and ensure an accurate and complete multi-currency corporate bank account opening application is submitted to the bank&#39;s in-house Legal and Compliance Department.</p><p>Unfortunately, the bank&#39;s in-house Legal and Compliance Department has the ultimate approval power over new multi-currency corporate bank account applications. This Department is highly risk-averse and often lacks touch with commercial reality. Furthermore, banking regulations do not allow the in-house Legal and Compliance Department to speak to customers or Golden Fish. All communications must go through the front office bank officer. Consequently, our Clients and our team often do not get the opportunity to communicate directly with the bank&#39;s decision-makers to adequately explain their business and the risks the bank perceives.</p><p>Upon successful multi-currency corporate bank account approval and once the business relationship with the customer has been established, the bank&#39;s in-house Legal and Compliance Department continues to monitor the customer&#39;s corporate bank account. Therefore, Golden Fish recommends our Clients put in place internal systems and processes, such as regular internal audits, transaction monitoring tools, and compliance training for staff, to ensure continuing compliance with each banking transaction of their corporate bank accounts to maintain the stable and healthy corporate relationship with the bank;</p></details></div>`);
