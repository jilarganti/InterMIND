While the general principles of doing business in free zones and on the mainland (mainland) are often similar across different emirates, each administrative division, whether it’s Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, or others, can have its own specific rules and requirements, particularly regarding taxation, minimum share capital, physical office requirements, and visa policies.
